# Parallax — How It Works (Judge Demo Flow)

A clean, judge-friendly, step-by-step product flow that shows **vision**, **feasibility**, and **execution** — without going deep into hardcore electronics.

---

## 1. User receives the Parallax badge

- **Thin, sleek, magnetic wearable badge**
- Clips cleanly to suit, blazer, shirt, hoodie
- **No buttons. No screens. No friction.**
- Only:
  - **LED bar** (Green → Yellow → Red)
  - **Hidden NFC chip** inside

---

## 2. First interaction — One tap setup (No account. No login.)

User taps phone on the badge.

**What happens:**

- NFC triggers the app instantly
- App opens directly into Parallax setup mode
- No signup
- No friction
- No cognitive load

**This is huge UX + product advantage.**

*"Tap → You're in."*

---

## 3. One-way pairing (Security + simplicity)

**On first tap:**

- **Badge sends:** Unique Device ID
- **App generates:** Secure pairing token

**Now:**

- **Phone ⇄ Badge** — Trusted pair established

**From now on:**

- Only that phone can control that badge.
- No accounts.
- No servers.
- No cloud.
- No privacy risk.

**Judges LOVE this.**

## 4. App interface (Simple. Beautiful. Non-AI.)

**Main screen:**

- A single beautiful control:
  - **Social Battery slider** — [ 100% | 75% | 50% | 25% ]
  - Or a circular dial
- User slides → color updates instantly.

---

## 5. Color system (3-state emotional clarity)

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| Green | Open, social, approachable |
| Yellow | Neutral, casual interaction |
| Red | Low energy, minimal interaction |

- No orange. No confusion.
- Instant interpretation.

---

## 6. User changes energy → taps badge

User adjusts slider → taps badge again.

**What happens:**

1. Phone sends selected energy state via NFC
2. Microcontroller updates LED color
3. Badge instantly reflects user’s mood

**This is the magic moment.**

They literally wear their social battery.

---

## 7. Real-world effect (Why this matters)

**At a networking event:**

Instead of:

- Social anxiety
- Forced conversations
- Awkward rejection

You get:

- Clear social boundaries
- Effortless signaling
- Reduced burnout
- Respectful communication

People approach based on color signal.

**This is powerful.**

---

## What judges understand instantly

This solves:

- Social fatigue
- Networking anxiety
- Overstimulation
- Social burnout
- Consent & boundaries

**In a subtle + beautiful way.**

---

## What’s happening technically (Judge-safe version)

You don’t say: *microcontrollers + power domains + firmware + etc*

You say:

> **"The badge contains an NFC chip and ultra-low-power microcontroller that listens for the phone and updates the LED instantly."**

That’s it.

## System architecture (simple slide)

```

```

- No cloud.
- No login.
- No servers.
- No tracking.
- **Private by design.**
